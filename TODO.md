- [ ] ENHANCEMENT: Dialogue speech box lights
- [ ] ENHANCEMENT: Improve dialogue portraits
- [ ] RECOMMENDATION: Needs more difficulty, new players ain't playing Y Sides first so we can add something to make it a bit harder (such as health drain)
- [ ] RECOMMENDATION: In middle scroll, some elements of HUD are in the way of the notes, make it uncomfortable to play
